This game is built with SpriteKit using the Swift language. The game and source code highlight some of the key features in SpriteKit, but also the power the Swift language can bring. This demo should show some of the core features of SpriteKit and standard game elements used in everyday games, but also a look into the syntax and core functionality of Swift. This is a start for people to look into the Swift language and SpriteKit.

* SKSpriteNode and Textures
* Parallax Background
